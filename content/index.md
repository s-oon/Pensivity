Hi there! My name is Senn (they/them), and it's nice to meet you!

Perhaps the best way to describe who I am and what I do is to call me a creative dabbler. If you can name something, chances are I've either tried to make it or want to try to make it - success isn't guaranteed, but the trying certainly is. Recently, I've been [making games](https://pensivity.itch.io) and learning different types of fabric crafts. I also have a [[portfolio/index|portfolio here on this website]] of a selection of things I've done that I'm particularly proud of.

On the professional and career side of life, the two threads connecting my experiences together are information and education. At the moment, my work is focused on upskilling researchers and university students in IT and programming. I'm also studying a Master of Information Science (Extended) at Curtin University with the aim of becoming a librarian.

So that's me in a nutshell! If you'd like to say hi, you can reach me at [senn@pensivity.xyz](mailto:senn@pensivity.xyz) or find me on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.au/@silverblue">Mastodon</a>. Thanks for reading, and have a great day.
