title: Jellyfish Lampshade
---
This beauty took maybe 6 months' worth of Saturday mornings to finish. It's made of brass wire, rose quartz, freshwater pearls, organza, tulle with fake pearls, and thread.

The hardest bit to finish was the part that attaches to the lampstand. It's hidden underneath the lightbulb, so it's not visible in the pictures, but it was a hassle to get the sizing and fit right and I'm super proud that I managed it.

These photos were taken by my teacher, Minnie Black, who runs [The Goldsmiths' School](https://www.goldsmiths-school.com/) over in Bardon. A lot of this project wouldn't have been possible without her guidance.
