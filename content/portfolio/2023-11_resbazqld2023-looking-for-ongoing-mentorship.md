title: ResBaz QLD 2023 - Looking for ongoing 1-on-1 mentorship after ResBaz? Start here!

I put together and ran this workshop having thought about the importance of having people you can trust to guide you through difficult journeys, of which research is one. A lot of people have guided (and will continue to guide!) me, and I think it's important to pass the spirit of it on. Pay it forward, as the saying goes.
