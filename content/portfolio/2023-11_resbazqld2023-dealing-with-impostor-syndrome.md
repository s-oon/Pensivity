I put together and ran this workshop having been inspired by Amanda Miotto's talk on impostor syndrome at ResBaz QLD 2022. It was my first time in a long while doing something like this, and I honestly felt a bit rusty, but I got good feedback from my 8 attendees. Here's hoping I get to do more like this in the future!
